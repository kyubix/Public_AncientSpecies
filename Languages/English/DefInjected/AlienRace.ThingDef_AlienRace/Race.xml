  <AS_WHE_Race.description>Half-Elves are a race created using the technology of the Glitter World, combining the characteristics of humans and elves. \n Living on a remote planet where they could not originally exist, these half-elves are thought to have been illegally traded among the Space Race and then crash-landed and settled on a remote planet due to spacecraft problems. \n  shooting, hunting, cultivating, and cooking in general, and they have good survival skills, but they are closed off and quite mechanically deaf.
